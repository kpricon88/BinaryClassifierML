Load and Prepare Data
*********************
-Loaded the data from the given file using required python libraries and prepared it further 
 for use for training and evaluating the model.
 
Dataset Encoding 
*******************
-Applied label encoding to the train data set for handling the categorical variables

Feature selection 
*******************
-Used feature selection to reduce the number of input variables for model prediction to optimise performance and computational cost
-Used Chi Square p-value here for the probability of obtaining data association/significance 
 
Model selection 
*****************
-Applied XGBoost model here because input variables are numeric and the problem 
given is a binary classification problem. 

Model tuning 
*************
-since model accuracy is high here(91.84), i have not used the tuning(but can use grid search for tuning) 

Model save
***********
-save the model for reuse to a file in disk


Deserialised the model 
***********************
-used pickle to serialise and desrielise here. 


NOTE:- Please use below pip commands if any dependencies missed while testing this in workspace

ex:- 
pip install xgboost
